Hi Michael,

I saw your portfolio on talentmatch.com and I figured I'd reach out to you.

My name is Tom, I'm a Software Engineer working for a small Engineering and Design studio called Studio Corsair in downtown San Francisco that develops products for small and mid-sized startups in the Bay Area and beyond.

We develop native Android and iOS apps, full-stack web applications, and a bit of hardware and machine learning sometimes.

We're looking for some Entry Level Software Engineers to join us for some new projects! 

Please let me know if you have any questions; you can read about the job in more details and submit an application at the following link:

Btw, your contact form and email address aren't working. Take care of them you will get more oppotunities. Good luck.
